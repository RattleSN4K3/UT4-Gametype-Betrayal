Description:
--------------------------------------------------------
Betrayal is a new instagib game type that pits players against each other while
they cooperate in temporary alliances. Only one player is the final winner, and
the difference between victory and defeat often lies in knowing when to betray
your teammates.

A score above opponents’ heads reflect their value if you gib them using the
primary fire of your instagib rifle. Current teammates are blue, and every kill
by a teammate adds one point to the team pot, which is shown at the top of your
HUD. Teammates can betray each other using the alternate fire of the rifle, which
shoots a blue beam. Assassinating a teammate gives the assassin both the score
over that player’s head, plus all the points accrued in the team pot.  

However, the assassin becomes a Rogue for 30 seconds, during which he is not on
any team, and his former teammates can garner a score bonus for achieving
retribution by killing him. The score above a Rogue’s head is red for his former
teammates.Once the rogue timer has counted down, the rogue will automatically
join a new team when teammates are available.
  
Daggers beside each player’s name shows the number of times that player has
betrayed his teammates.  Watch your back around teammates; you’ll often see
players pause and check each other out as they enter a room together.

Sometimes, players may try to goad a teammate into killing them by shooting blue
beams by their ear when the team pot is small, hoping to later cash in on the
retribution bonus.  As the players near victory, they’ll often try to time a
final betrayal to send them over the top.
